# Transport Platform Control Systen

Control system for platform transport project written for my master thesis.

## Description

Project of a transport platform with vibration reduction system. Vibration reduction is achieved be controling carts position and speed. 
Orientation of platform is obtained based on data from digital accelerometers/gyroscopes (MPU9250, MPU6886) and filtratration algorithms (e.g. Kalman filter).
Actual carts position is measured by optical sensors (Sharp GP2Y0A21YK0F).
STM32 NUCLEO-L476RG board is used for motors control system. It generaters step/dir signals based on data recieved from control MCU (STM32 NUCLEO-F767ZI board) and position measured by optical sensors.
STM32 NUCLEO-F767ZI board is responsible for: acquiring data from accelerometers/gyroscopes and signal filtration, regulation system, sending steering data to motor control board (STM32 NUCLEO-L476RG board), communication with external PC via Ethernet interface.

## Instalation
* Repository doesn't include HAL library files. In this case it is required to at first generate blank project for each board and then swap *core* files with generated ones.
